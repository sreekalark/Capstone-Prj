
I want to use my skills in Data Analysis & Machine Learning and find out a neighborhood in Toronto which would be apt for building an Adult Living Community. When looking out for such a neighborhood, the things that I would like are – proximity to hospital, healthy eateries nearby (not fast food), libraries, museums, park, away from busy school communities etc.
Primary Target / Audience:
The people most interested in this would be of course Senior Citizens or people above age of 50 who want to lead a peaceful retired life. They would surely need a neighborhood which doesn’t have all the noisiness, pollution, crowd that metropolitan cities have, but surely it should have modern amenities and easy access to Areas of Interest.
